# Understanding Computation: From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs

Finally, you can learn computation theory and programming language design in an engaging, practical way. Understanding Computation explains theoretical computer science in a context you’ll recognize, helping you appreciate why these ideas matter and how they can inform your day-to-day programming.

* Understand fundamental computing concepts, such as Turing completeness in languages
* Discover how programs use dynamic semantics to communicate ideas to machines
* Explore what a computer can do when reduced to its bare essentials
* Learn how universal Turing machines led to today’s general-purpose computers
* Perform complex calculations, using simple languages and cellular automata
* Determine which programming language features are essential for computation
* Examine how halting and self-referencing make some computing problems unsolvable
* Analyze programs by using abstract interpretation and type systems
