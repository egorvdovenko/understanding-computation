# Understanding Computation: From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs

This project is a TypeScript implementation of the examples from *Understanding Computation: From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs* by Tom Stuart. It brings the concepts from the book to life in a modern programming language, allowing you to explore computation theory and programming language design hands-on.

* Implement fundamental computing concepts, such as Turing completeness, in TypeScript
* Simulate dynamic semantics to understand how programs communicate ideas to machines
* Experiment with minimal computational models to grasp the essence of computation
* Recreate universal Turing machines and explore their connection to general-purpose computing
* Perform complex calculations using simple languages and cellular automata in TypeScript
* Investigate essential programming language features for computation
* Explore unsolvable computing problems like halting and self-referencing
* Analyze programs with abstract interpretation and type systems in a practical way

This repository serves as a companion to the book, providing TypeScript-based examples to deepen your understanding of theoretical computer science concepts.
