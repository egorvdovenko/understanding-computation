# Deterministic Pushdown Automata

**Deterministic Pushdown Automata (DPA)** is a theoretical model of computation that extends finite automata by adding a stack as auxiliary memory. DPAs are used to recognize context-free languages, which are more expressive than regular languages.

### Key Concepts:
1. **States**: A finite set of states the automaton can be in.
2. **Alphabet**: A finite set of symbols the automaton can process.
3. **Stack Alphabet**: A finite set of symbols that can be stored in the stack.
4. **Transition Function**: Defines how the automaton moves between states based on input symbols and the stack's top symbol.
5. **Start State**: The state where the automaton begins.
6. **Accepting States**: A subset of states that indicate successful recognition of input.
7. **Stack**: A memory structure that allows push and pop operations.

### Characteristics:
- **Deterministic**: For each state, input symbol, and stack top symbol, there is at most one transition.
- **Stack Operations**: The stack enables the automaton to handle nested structures, such as matching parentheses.
- **Context-Free Languages**: DPAs are capable of recognizing languages generated by context-free grammars.

### Applications:
- Parsing programming languages.
- Validating nested structures, such as XML or JSON.
- Recognizing context-free patterns in strings.

Deterministic Pushdown Automata are foundational in the study of formal languages and automata theory, bridging the gap between regular and context-free languages.
