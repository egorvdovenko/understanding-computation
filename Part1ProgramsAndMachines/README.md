# Part 1: Programs and Machines

This section explores foundational concepts in computation, focusing on the meaning of programs and the simplest computational models.

## Contents

1. **The Meaning of Programs**:
   - **Small-Step Semantics**: Describes how programs are executed step-by-step, focusing on intermediate states.
   - **Big-Step Semantics**: Focuses on evaluating programs directly to their final result in one "big step."
   - **Denotational Semantics**: Maps programs to mathematical objects, providing an abstract description of their behavior.

2. **The Simplest Computers**:
   - **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**: A computational model that recognizes patterns with deterministic transitions.
   - **Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**: A computational model that allows multiple simultaneous states and epsilon transitions.
   - **Regular Expressions**: A formal language for defining patterns in strings, closely related to finite automata.
   - **Equivalence**: Demonstrates the equivalence between different computational models, such as NFAs and DFAs.

3. **Just Add Power**:
   - **Deterministic Pushdown Automata (DPA)**: Extends finite automata with a stack to recognize context-free languages. DPAs are used for parsing nested structures and validating context-free patterns.
   
Each folder contains detailed explanations, examples, and implementations of these concepts.
