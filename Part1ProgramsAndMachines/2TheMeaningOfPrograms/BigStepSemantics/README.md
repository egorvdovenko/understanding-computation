# Big-Step Semantics

The small-step approach has the advantage of slicing up the complex business of executing an entire program into smaller pieces that are easier to explain and analyze, but it does feel a bit indirect: instead of explaining how a whole program construct works, we just show how it can be reduced slightly. Why can’t we explain a statement more directly, by telling a complete story about how its execution works? Well, we can, andthat’s the basis of big-step semantics.

The idea of big-step semantics is to specify how to get from an expression or statement straight to its result. This necessarily involves thinking about program execution as a recursive rather than an iterative process: big-step semantics says that, to evaluate a large expression, we evaluate all of its smaller subexpressions and then combine their results to get our final answer.
