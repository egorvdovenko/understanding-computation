# Big-Step Semantics

**Big-Step Semantics** is a formal approach to defining the meaning of programs by describing how entire computations are evaluated in a single step. It focuses on the final result of a computation rather than the intermediate steps.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Evaluation**: Expressions and statements are evaluated directly to their final values or resulting environments.
2. **Environment**: A mapping of variable names to their values, which provides context for evaluating expressions and statements.
3. **Expressions and Statements**:
   - **Expressions**: Represent computations that produce values (e.g., arithmetic or boolean operations).
   - **Statements**: Represent actions that modify the environment (e.g., assignments, conditionals, loops).

### Characteristics:
- **Direct Evaluation**: The semantics describe how to evaluate a program to its final result in one "big step."
- **Abstract**: Focuses on the outcome of computation rather than the process.
- **Deterministic**: The result of evaluation is uniquely determined by the program and its input.

Big-step semantics is widely used in programming language theory to define the meaning of programs in a concise and abstract way.
