# Small-Step Semantics

**Small-Step Semantics** is a formal approach to defining the behavior of programs by describing how individual steps of computation are performed. It focuses on the incremental reduction of expressions or statements until they reach their final result.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Reduction**: Each step in the computation reduces a complex expression or statement into a simpler one.
2. **Environment**: A mapping of variables to their values, which provides context for evaluating expressions.
3. **Expressions**: Represent computations that produce values (e.g., arithmetic or boolean operations).
4. **Statements**: Represent actions that modify the environment (e.g., assignments, conditionals, loops).

### Characteristics:
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Programs are evaluated one small step at a time, making the process explicit.
- **Intermediate States**: Each step produces an intermediate state, showing the progression of computation.
- **Deterministic**: The next step is always uniquely determined by the current state.

Small-step semantics is widely used in programming language theory to model and analyze the execution of programs.
