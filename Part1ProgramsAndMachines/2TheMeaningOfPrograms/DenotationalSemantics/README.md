# Denotational Semantics

**Denotational Semantics** is a formal approach to defining the meaning of programs by mapping them to mathematical objects, such as functions or values. It provides a high-level, abstract description of program behavior without focusing on the step-by-step execution.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Mathematical Mapping**: Programs are represented as mathematical functions that map inputs (e.g., environments) to outputs (e.g., values or updated environments).
2. **Environment**: A mapping of variable names to their values, which provides context for evaluating expressions and statements.
3. **Compositionality**: The meaning of a program is derived from the meanings of its parts, ensuring modularity and clarity.

### Characteristics:
- **Abstract**: Focuses on the result of computation rather than the process.
- **Compositional**: The semantics of complex constructs are built from the semantics of simpler ones.
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Provides a precise and unambiguous description of program behavior.

Denotational semantics is widely used in programming language theory to reason about program correctness, equivalence, and optimization.
