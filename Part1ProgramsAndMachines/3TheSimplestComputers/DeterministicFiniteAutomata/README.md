# Deterministic Finite Automata

A **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** is a theoretical model of computation used to recognize patterns in strings. It consists of a finite set of states, transitions between those states based on input symbols, and a set of accepting states that determine whether a given input is accepted.

### Key Components:
1. **States**: A finite set of states the automaton can be in.
2. **Alphabet**: A finite set of symbols the automaton can process.
3. **Transition Function**: Defines how the automaton moves between states based on input symbols.
4. **Start State**: The state where the automaton begins.
5. **Accepting States**: A subset of states that indicate successful recognition of input.

### Characteristics:
- **Deterministic**: For each state and input symbol, there is exactly one transition to a next state.
- **Finite**: The number of states and transitions is finite.

DFAs are widely used in computer science for tasks such as lexical analysis, pattern matching, and designing simple control systems.
