# Regular Expressions

**Regular Expressions** are a formal language used to define patterns for matching strings. They are widely used in computer science for tasks such as text processing, pattern recognition, and lexical analysis.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Patterns**: Combinations of characters and operators that define a set of strings.
2. **Operators**:
   - **Concatenation**: Combines two patterns sequentially (e.g., `ab` matches "ab").
   - **Choice (Alternation)**: Matches one of multiple patterns (e.g., `a|b` matches "a" or "b").
   - **Repetition**: Matches zero or more occurrences of a pattern (e.g., `a*` matches "", "a", "aa", etc.).
3. **Literals**: Match exact characters (e.g., `a` matches "a").
4. **Empty Pattern**: Matches an empty string.

### Characteristics:
- **Expressive**: Can describe a wide range of string patterns.
- **Compact**: Patterns are concise and easy to write.
- **Efficient**: Can be implemented using finite automata for fast matching.

Regular expressions are foundational in text processing, programming languages, and theoretical computer science.
